# Keyboard-Check-Project
The Keyboard Check project is a simple, interactive web application that listens for keypress events and dynamically displays information about the pressed key. The application is designed with a minimalist style, showcasing real-time key event data in a tabular format, including the key name, key code, and code value.

This project demonstrates the usage of JavaScript event listeners and DOM manipulation techniques, combined with responsive styling using HTML and CSS.
